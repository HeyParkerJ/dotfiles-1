=prog-mode= is a general mode for any programming mode. Settings applied in
=prog-mode= will be reflected in practically any mode with code or configuration
files. It generally doesn't effect text files.

* auto fill comments
  I'm not sure how I feel about using =auto-fill-mode= for normal code, but for
  comments this is a must to me. Fortunately =auto-fill-mode= comes with
  =comment-auto-fill-only-comments=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defun config/auto-fill-comments ()
      "Turn on `auto-fill-mode' and disable it for everything but comments."
      (setq-local comment-auto-fill-only-comments t)
      (auto-fill-mode 1)
      )
  #+end_src

* all together

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'config/auto-fill-comments)
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'display-line-numbers-mode)
  #+end_src
