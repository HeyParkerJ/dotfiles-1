* frame
  In large/expensive buffers, =which-key= can be very unresponsive to bring up
  because resizing the minibuffer is also expensive. To keep =which-key= from
  invoking the minibuffer, open it as a frame instead.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
    (defun config/which-key-use-frame ()
      (setq-default which-key-popup-type 'frame)
      )
  #+end_src

* all together
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'use-package)

    (use-package "which-key"
      :defer t
      :config
      (config/which-key-use-frame)
      )
  #+end_src
