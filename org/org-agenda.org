* save buffers on changing todos

  Changes in =org-agenda= write to the buffers that own the original TODO items
  but they do not save the buffer (which means a crash or other problem could
  remove my progress recorded). Auto-save may take care of this, but I don't see
  why we wouldn't just save the results anyways.

  I found a solution on this [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/21754/how-to-automatically-save-all-org-files-after-marking-a-repeating-item-as-done-i][SO post]], which I have adopted slightly (mostly so I
  don't have a function named after a glyph I can't readily type).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
    (defmacro unrest (fnc)
      "Return function that ignores its arguments and invokes FNC."
      `(lambda (&rest _rest)
         (funcall ,fnc)))
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
    (advice-add 'org-deadline       :after (unrest #'org-save-all-org-buffers))
    (advice-add 'org-schedule       :after (unrest #'org-save-all-org-buffers))
    (advice-add 'org-store-log-note :after (unrest #'org-save-all-org-buffers))
    (advice-add 'org-todo           :after (unrest #'org-save-all-org-buffers))
  #+end_src
