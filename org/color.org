#+title: Color

* brighter fringes
I like =doom-vibrant= I think, but I can barely see the line numbers when I'm
not in a dark room. We need to bump up their contrast a bit. Perhaps we could
even make them the same gray color as vanilla text, but use a separator line.

  (set-face-attribute 'line-number nil
                        :foreground "gray"
                        :background "black"
                        )
  )
