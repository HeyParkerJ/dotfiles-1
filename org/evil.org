** evil-collection
   =evil-collection= is a user maintained list of =evil-mode= bindings. It's not
   very compatible with the Spacemacs way of doing things, and I've had trouble
   getting some of the keybindings to work properly. For now I've opted to not
   use =evil-collection= and instead wire up my own bindings by hand. I've found
   a way to do this that seems to work consistently enough.
* evil-snipe
The =evil-snipe= package promises better/smarter searching for =f=, =F=, =t=, and
=T=. I am giving it a shot, though I am holding out judgment so far.
** case sensitivity
Doom uses the smart case by default. While I enjoy this with =/= I do not enjoy
it here. The motions =evil-snipe= uses need to be precise in my mind.
