** evil-collection
   =evil-collection= is a user maintained list of =evil-mode= bindings. It's not
   very compatible with the Spacemacs way of doing things, and I've had trouble
   getting some of the keybindings to work properly. For now I've opted to not
   use =evil-collection= and instead wire up my own bindings by hand. I've found
   a way to do this that seems to work consistently enough.
