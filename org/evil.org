* evil-mode
** evil-collection
   Trying to add =evil-mode= bindings has been problematic for me, partly I
   think because there are problems with setting key bindings (see
   [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/301][emacs-evil#301]] for the author's frustration with the system).

   =evil-collection= is a user maintained list of =evil-mode= bindings. Let's
   just turn it on globally.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
   (evil-collection-init)
   #+end_src
