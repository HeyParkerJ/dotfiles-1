Java support in Emacs is surprisingly new, despite the age of both
tools/ecosystems.

* lsp
  The Language Server Protocol (LSP) can work with Java.

** eclipse language server

   At time of writing there's no Homebrew for this. Another script will download
   and unpack it in a location. We have to tell =lsp-java= where to find it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun config/set-eclipse-language-server-dir ()
 (setq-default lsp-java-server-install-dir "/usr/local/opt/eclipse-language-server")
)
#+end_src

** organizing imports
   By default organizing imports is done automatically. This creates a large
   churn in the diffs for commits. Disabling it is the sensible thing to do.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (defun config/disable-organize-imports-on-save()
       (setq-default lsp-java-save-action-organize-imports nil)
     )
   #+end_src
* hooking it up

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'use-package)

  (use-package "lsp-java"
    :config
    (config/disable-organize-imports-on-save)
  )
    ;; (add-hook 'java-mode-hook (lambda ()
    ;;   (require 'lsp-java)
    ;;   (add-hook 'java-mode-hook #'lsp-java-enable)
    ;;   (config/set-eclipse-language-server-dir)
    ;; ))
#+end_src
