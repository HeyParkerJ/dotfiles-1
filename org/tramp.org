* shell settings

Tramp logs in via =ssh= as one of its modes. When it does so, it interacts with
the shell over =ssh=. It doesn't understand custom prompts very well, let alone
things specific to =zsh=. Generally Tramp expects =bash=. This setting makes
Tramp use bash regardless of what the remote machine is set to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (setq-default explicit-shell-file-name "/bin/bash")
#+end_src

* debugging

Tramp can be debugged with a verbose number. I know you can set it as high as 6.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun set-tramp-logging ()
    ;; (setq-default tramp-verbose 6)
  )
#+end_src

* all together

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'use-package)
  (use-package "tramp"
    :init
    :config
    (set-tramp-logging)
  )
#+end_src
