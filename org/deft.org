* introduction

Deft builds a list of org files that is searchable (only in =holy-mode=?). The
entries are listed by title with a small snippet of the content to fill the
gaps. When you search it searches the contents of the all of the files.

* privacy

Some files I don't want to search. I need to look into some kind of privacy
settings.

* bad results
Files without =org-mode= titles display kind of funny, which I should
clean up anyways.

* just org-mode?

Looks like it was picking up my old markdown files too. I think I just want it
to search =org-mode= so I'll need to look at that too, or just fix the data.
