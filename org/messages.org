=messages-mode= is used when viewing a message buffer. Generally this is where
logs are stored.

* evilification

  In a recent update of Spacemacs, =evil-mode= bindings seem to have been
  truncated. Namely, my normal =C-w= window prefix died. Let's restore it.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
      (defun config/evilify-evil-window-prefix ()
        "Setup window prefixed commands"
        (interactive)
        ;; The docs state you can use the mode name directly instead of a map within
        ;; it. This resolves problems where certain modes seem to ignore
        ;; `evil-define-key'.
        ;; https://github.com/noctuid/evil-guide#why-dont-keys-defined-with-evil-define-key-work-immediately
        (evil-define-key 'evilified 'messages-buffer-mode
          (kbd "C-w h") 'evil-window-left
          (kbd "C-w j") 'evil-window-down
          (kbd "C-w k") 'evil-window-up
          (kbd "C-w l") 'evil-window-right
          ;; TODO: More to come with other window functions.
          ;; TODO: Consider using https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection
          ;; TODO: Consider generalizing this for other modes
          )
        (message "window prefix configured")
        )
  #+end_src

* integrate

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'use-package)
    (use-package "messages-buffer-mode"
      :defer t
      :init
      (message "initializing messages-mode")
      :config
      ;; The config section doesn't seem to get invoked. DO NOT PUT CODE HERE.

      ;; TODO: Look into `messages-buffer-mode' instead and this might just work out
      ;; of box.
      (config/evilify-evil-window-prefix)
      )
  #+end_src
