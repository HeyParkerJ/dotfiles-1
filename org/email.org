* introduction

  There's a lot of benefits to using Emacs to read and write emails.

  1. I can use text and tagging to search for emails easily.
  2. I can keep keybindings that I am familiar with for both reading and writing
     emails.
  3. Copying text out of emails is easy.
  4. Writing emails can be done with =org-mode=, which means I can use code for
     composing some parts of emails.
  5. I can handle GPG encryption automatically.
  6. My emails can be stored in some universal open source format.
  7. Color scheme is dark.

  Reading and writing email is kind of the holy grail of Emacs configurations.
  Emacs can author emails in =org-mode= and then export them to some email
  format. Amusingly, I think one of the bigger reasons I want email inside of
  emacs right now is the combined vim bindings plus a dark color scheme. Once I
  have replaced Apple Mail as my primary email client, all I have remaining as a
  major hurdle is Apple Calendar, which I think I can replace with Emacs as well
  (but in time).

* tools used
** isync

   =isync= is a library/tool that syncs with an IMAP account (Gmail speaks
   IMAP). =isync= isn't the name of the executable itself. Instead this is
   =mbsync=, and generally I use it with =mbsync -a=. I've found a few blog
   posts to help get me started.

** mu4e

   =mu4e= is the Emacs interface for =mu=, which does email tagging and
   searching. I haven't set this up yet. I found a Spacemacs layer for it as
   [[https://github.com/cmiles74/spacemacs-notmuch-layer][spacemacs-notmuch-layer]]. It needs =mu= itself installed.

** notmuch

   =notmuch= is installed as a =spacemacs= layer. There's a
   [[https://github.com/cmiles74/spacemacs-notmuch-layer][spacemacs-notmuch-layer]] repository for this, as it is not built in. Not much
   is just a way of navigating and tagging emails. It doesn't handle the
   syncing.

*** keybindings

    The keybindings here are in sore need of love for something that works for
    my muscle memory.

* research

  - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/4rl0a9/email_in_emacs_i_want_to_but_wow_its_overwhelming/d52q08p/][IceDane's Emacs email setup]] :: =IceDane= has very good rationale of the
       setup they use and goes through all of the things they have tried. I want
       to closely follow this setup.
  - [[https://notmuchmail.org/notmuch-emacs/][notmuch Emacs interface]] :: Official documentation for using =notmuch= with
       Emacs.
  - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Isync][ArchLinux isync config]] :: Tutorial on setting up =isync=.
  - [[http://www.ict4g.net/adolfo/notes/2014/12/27/emacs-imap.html][Adolfo Villafiorita's IMAP in Emacs + MacOS setup]] :: This has been a rich
       trove of information about a setup similar to =IceDane='s. It includes a
       little bit alternatives and also different approaches with additional
       passes on existing configs (such as adding oauth support via Gmail).
  - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/7me0vn/help_configuring_mbsyncrc_for_gmail_on_osx/][isync "unknown section keyword" problem]] :: I ran into this problem. The fix
       is that sections are grouped together by a lack of an extra line break.
       Extra linebreak (two in a row) means there's a new section.
  - [[https://docwhat.org/el-capitan-and-the-evils-of-openssl/][OpenSSL and CertificateFile]] :: Homebrew provides a pem file that can be used
       in the =CertificateFile= field for =.mbsyncrc= (=isync='s config file).
       This gives us the root certificate authority needed to establish a chain
       of trust with gmail's certificates.

* alternative tools

*** gnus

    I have tried =gnus= which is built into Spacemacs as a layer. =gnus= is
    meant as more of an RSS aggregator than anything else. I had a lot of
    trouble syncing with Gmail, writing emails, and reading them. The
    documentation for evilication is sparse at best, and I just get the feel
    that while using =gnus= for email is clever, it just feels like stretching a
    tool to be something it isn't.
