This file is specifically for global key bindings that don't belong to a
particular major or minor mode.

* execute interactive functions
Generally this is bound to =M-x=. Spacemacs has a good default and I'd like to
stick with it.

#+name: execute
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none :tangle yes
(map!
  :leader
  :desc "Execute a function"
  :n "SPC" #'counsel-M-x
  )
(on-doom
  (after! projectile
    (map!
      :leader
      :desc "Execute a function"
      :n "SPC" #'counsel-M-x
      )
    )
)
#+end_src

* stitch
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none :noweb yes
