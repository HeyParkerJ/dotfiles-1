This config section goes over all font related things.

* faces

  The font face system (I don't know the package name at this time) covers
  "fontification" and is a kind of system where font settings (bold, color,
  background color, size, etc) can be applied in an additive fashion. This is
  typically called a face or font face in the Emacs lexicon.
** what-face

   This utility lifted from [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/1242366/4618043][this stack overflow post]] covers getting font face
   information from the cursor.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
     (defun what-face (&optional pos)
       "Determine the font face under POS."
       (interactive "d")
       (let ((pos (or pos (point))))
             (let ((face (or (get-char-property pos 'read-face-name)
                             (get-char-property pos 'face))))
               (if face (message "Face: %s" face) (message "No face at %d" pos)))
         ))
   #+end_src
